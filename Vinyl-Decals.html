    <h1>Creating Custom Art with Vinyl Decals on Epoxy Resin</h1>
  <p>Looking to add some unique flair to your art collection? Custom art with vinyl decals on epoxy resin is a great way to achieve that! Here's how:<img src="pics/1.jpg"></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather your materials: epoxy resin, vinyl, a mixing cup, stirring utensil, and a heat gun or torch and the canvas or item you plan to add the decal on
        (remember to use the right resin as well, thick doming resin rather than casting resin is perfect for this project.) You can use
        masking tape to cover areas you don't want resin to touch and be sure to use gloves and cover you work area with plastic.</li>
    <li>Create your design: use a software like Cricut Design Space(Cricut machines are a popular choice for crafters and makers, but they can be 
        expensive. There are a number of alternatives to Cricut machines that offer similar features at a lower price point. Some popular alternatives 
        include the Silhouette Cameo, the Brother ScanNCut, and the Sizzix Big Shot.
        The Silhouette Cameo is a popular alternative to the Cricut Maker. It has a similar cutting width and can cut a variety of materials, including 
        paper, vinyl, and fabric. The Silhouette Cameo is also compatible with a wide range
        of software, making it a versatile option for crafters.
        The Brother ScanNCut is another popular alternative to the Cricut Maker. It has a built-in scanner, which makes it easy to create projects from 
        your own designs. The Brother ScanNCut can also cut a variety of materials, including paper, vinyl, and fabric.
        The Sizzix Big Shot is a manual die-cutting machine. It is a good option for crafters who want a more affordable option than the Cricut Maker or 
        the Silhouette Cameo. The Sizzix Big Shot can cut a variety of materials, including paper, cardstock, and thin metal.
        When choosing an alternative to a Cricut machine, it is important to consider your needs and budget. If you need a machine that can cut a 
        variety of materials, the Silhouette Cameo or the Brother ScanNCut may be a good option. If you are looking for a more affordable option, the 
        Sizzix Big Shot may be a good choice). Be sure to size it appropriately for your project.</li>
    <li>Place your vinyl decals onto your desired surface, making sure they're positioned correctly.
      use transfer tape
Here are the steps on how to place vinyl decals onto your desired surface using transfer tape:

Use a weeding tool to make it easier to remove the negative space.
Start with the largest pieces of negative space and work your way down to the smallest pieces.
Be careful not to remove any of the design that you want to keep.

Prepare your surface. Make sure it is clean, dry, and smooth.
After you have weeded,
peel off the backing paper from the vinyl decal with the transfer tape applied (depending on the detail in the design, this can take practice)
Place the vinyl decal on the desired surface, making sure it is positioned correctly.

Use a squeegee to smooth out the design, removing any air bubbles.
Slowly peel off the transfer tape, starting from one corner and working your way to the other.
If any of the vinyl decal comes off with the transfer tape, place it back down and smooth it out again.
If you make a mistake, you can use a hair dryer to heat the transfer tape and then peel it off.      </li>
    <li>Mix your epoxy resin according to the instructions on the package.</li>
    <li>Pour your epoxy resin over your surface, covering your vinyl decals completely.</li>
    <li>Use a heat gun or torch to remove any bubbles in your resin(do not over do this, little goes a long way).</li>
    <li>Allow your resin to cure for the recommended time.</li>
    <li>Your custom art with vinyl decals on epoxy resin is now ready to display!</li>
  </ol>
