        <h2 class="header">Watercolor Art Pricing</h2>
        <p>I love creating watercolor paintings, and I'm always happy to work with people to create a custom piece of art. My paintings are priced at 50 cents per square inch, plus the percentage added by the platform the art is sold on. So, if you were to buy a painting from me on Poshmark, I would add 20% to the final price. The size of your painting is determined by its width and height in inches. For example, a 12x16 inch painting would be 192 square inches, and would cost $96.</p>
        <p>If you're interested in commissioning a custom watercolor painting, please contact me for a quote. I can create paintings of any size, subject matter, or style. I'm always happy to work with people to create a piece of art that they love.</p>
        <p>Watercolor artwork done by Danny Prock <br>Thank you for your interest in my work!</p>
