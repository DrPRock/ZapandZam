		<p>Wire wrapping is a popular jewelry making technique that involves wrapping wire around beads, stones, and other materials to create beautiful and unique pieces. One of the most popular types of wire used in this technique is sterling silver wire.</p>
		<p>Sterling silver wire is a high-quality material that is perfect for wire wrapping. It is strong, durable, and easy to work with. Additionally, it has a beautiful shine that complements many different types of materials.</p>
		<p>Using found copper wire for making jewelry can be a fun and creative way to recycle materials and create unique pieces. Copper wire is malleable, making it easy to shape into various forms and designs. It can be polished to a high shine or left to develop a natural patina over time. Additionally, using found materials can add a special story or meaning to your jewelry creations.</p>
		<p>When wire wrapping with beads, natural stones, synthetic materials, and embellishments, it's important to choose materials that complement each other. For example, you might choose to use colorful beads with a neutral-colored stone, or you might add a touch of sparkle with some embellishments.</p>
		<p>There are many different techniques you can use when wire wrapping, including basic loops, wrapped loops, and more advanced techniques like the cage wrap. With practice, you can create stunning jewelry pieces that are sure to impress.</p>

        <p>Embellishments, such as charms, pendants, and tassels, can add a unique touch to wire wrapped jewelry. These can be attached to the wire using jump rings or other connectors. You can also experiment with different wire gauges to create different effects in your jewelry pieces.</p>
